Hello, welcome to my repository, before we begin, I must
apologize for my bad english. This is a small repository
I created to make my project real, I wanted to build an
Oreo rom for Moto E4 Plus so I worked a few months on top
of this code to create a code that would allow a successful
build of Lineage OS, I should warn you that this is a Beta,
the code here probably will not work with all available Roms
or even worse, it may crash when trying to compile, I should
ask you to wait a while, I'm still packing a few things. Here
I'll leave some source codes available for several roms as I
add them. When looking through my repository you will find
the code of the device tree and the code to compile the kernel.
Please, when using this code, put my name on the credits
and add links to this repository so that more people can
develop for the Moto E4 Plus. Thx for the attention :-)
